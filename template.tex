    \begin{verse}
        ^{Am}Dance me to your beauty with a ^{Em}burning violin \\
        ^{Am}Dance me through the panic 'til I'm ^{Em}gathered safely in \\
        ^{Am}Lift me like an olive branch and ^{Em}be my homeward dove \\
        ^{B7}Dance me to the end of ^{Em}love \\
        ^{B7}Dance me to the end of ^{Em}love
    \end{verse}

        ^Oh let me see your beauty when the ^witnesses are gone \\
        ^Let me feel you moving like they ^do in Babylon \\
        ^Show me slowly what I only ^know the limits of \\
        ^Dance me to the end of ^love \\
        ^Dance me to the end of ^love

        ^Dance me to the wedding now, ^dance me on and on \\

    \begin{verse}
        ^{Am}I do believe there's a ^{C/G}chance \\
        That's not a ^{Em}chance, not a ^{Am}chance \\
        ^{Am}You care to spare me a ^{C/G}dance \\
        Not a ^{Em}chance, not a ^{Am}chance \\

Capo I
## Intro
C

    \begin{verse}
          ^{F^7}Every time I ^{G}think of you \\
        I get a ^{Em}shot right through into a ^{Am/E}bolt of blue \\
        It's no ^{F}problem of mine but it's a ^{G}problem I find \\
        ^{Em}Living a life that I ^{Am/E}can't leave ^{Amsus2}behind \\
        ^{F}There's no sense in ^{G}telling me \\
        The ^{Em}wisdom of a fool won't ^{Am/E}set you free \\
        But that's the ^{F}way that it goes \\
        And it's what ^{G}nobody knows \\
        And ^{Em}every day my ^{Am/E}confusion grows
    \end{verse}

    \begin{chorus}
        ^{F}Every time I ^{G}see you falling
        Em                Am/E   Amsus2
        I get down on my knees and ^{pray
          F  (Fsus4)               G
        I'm waiting for that final moment
              Em                   Am/E          C
        You'll  say the words that I can't say
    \end{chorus}
 
## Verse
FMaj7             G
  I feel fine and I feel good
Em              Am/E
 I feel like I never should
         F                              G
Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
             Em                        Am/E
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
F                   G
 I'm not sure what this could mean
Em                    Am/E
 I don't think you're what you seem
        F
I do admit to myself
           G
That if I hurt someone else
          Em                        Am/E
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
 
## Chorus
F             G
Every time I see you falling
  Em               Am/E
I get down on my knees and pray
  F                  G
I'm waiting for that final moment
      Em                   Am/E           C
You'll  say the words that I can't say
